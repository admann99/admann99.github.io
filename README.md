## Introduction
All Day is a 70 minute long mashup by the artist girltalk. In all day, over 300 samples are used to create the album. Although it is a whole album, the songs flow together so it feels like a single song.

There is some discussion about whether the album violates fair use. Although it does use numerous works of music for free, the law surrounding fair use is vague. To determine if a song is fair use, there are four factors to consider:

## The Purpose and Character of your use

This has been cited as the primary factor to consider when evaluating if a case is fair use. The main issue here is whether the artist is merely copying someone else work or using their work to create something new. The following questions should be asked to determine if a work violates this policy, according to (stanford.edu)[http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/#the_transformative_factor_the_purpose_and_character_of_your_use]:

> - Has the material you have taken from the original work been transformed by adding new expression or meaning?
> - Was value added to the original by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights, and understandings?

The material from the original work has been transformed since layering several samples on top of each other adds new expression.

The second case also appears to be satisfied. By meshing samples together, Girltalk creates an entirely new work of art, similar to a collage.


## The Nature of The Copyrighted work
This states that there is more leway to copy factual works than you do fiction. Obviously that doesn't apply to this case.

Also, if the material has already been published, it is more likely to be considered fair use. That's because artists should be able to control when their work is released. Girltalk uses samples from songs that have already been released, so he does not violate this.


## The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Taken
In more cases than not, a smaller amount taken from the work means that it is more likely to be considered fair use. Girltalk uses very short samples. Furthermore, most have his samples only contain one track of it. For example, he might include the drums from one sample, guitar from another sample, and vocals from a 3rd sample.

Even with small samples, if a sample contains the "heart" of the work, it is much less likely to be considered fair use. Most of his samples do not contain any recognizable part of the song, but some contain parts of the chorus. Although this could be argued as being the "heart" of the work, it is very unsubstantial and is not enough to make a case against him.
