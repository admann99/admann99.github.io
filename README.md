## Introduction
[*All Day*](http://illegal-art.net/allday/) is a 70 minute long mashup by the artist girltalk. In *All Day*, over 372 samples are used to create the album. Although it is released as a 12-track album format, the songs flow together so it feels like a single song. Girl talk released it as a free digital download in 2010.

## Is *All Day* fair use?
Since the technology for mashups such as *All Day* is fairly recent, there is not yet a precedent for their legal status. This puts the album in a unique position. Although Girl Talk samples several artists without paying royalties, there is a lot to consider when determining if music is fair use. This could have far reaching implications beyond *All Day*, since it could set a precedent for other mashups.

To determine if a song is fair use, there are four factors to consider:

### The Purpose and Character of your use

This has been cited as the primary factor to consider when evaluating if a case is fair use. The main issue here is whether the artist is merely copying someone else work or using their work to create something new. The following questions should be asked to determine if a work violates this policy, according to [stanford.edu](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/#the_transformative_factor_the_purpose_and_character_of_your_use):

> - Has the material you have taken from the original work been transformed by adding new expression or meaning?
> - Was value added to the original by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights, and understandings?

The material from the original work has been transformed since layering several samples on top of each other adds new expression.

The second case also appears to be satisfied. By meshing samples together, Girltalk creates an entirely new work of art, similar to a collage.


### The Nature of The Copyrighted work
This states that there is more leway to copy factual works than you do fiction. Obviously that doesn't apply to this case.

Also, if the material has already been published, it is more likely to be considered fair use. That's because artists should be able to control when their work is released. Girltalk uses samples from songs that have already been released, so he does not violate this.


### The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Taken
In more cases than not, a smaller amount taken from the work means that it is more likely to be considered fair use. Girltalk uses very short samples. Furthermore, most have his samples only contain one track of it. For example, he might include the drums from one sample, guitar from another sample, and vocals from a 3rd sample.

Even with small samples, if a sample contains the "heart" of the work, it is much less likely to be considered fair use. Most of his samples do not contain any recognizable part of the song, but some contain parts of the chorus. Although this could be argued as being the "heart" of the work, it is very unsubstantial and is not enough to make a case against him.


### The Effect of The Use Upon the Potential Market

Another important factor is the work's impact on the market. In the music industry, this can be done in two ways. First of all, we need to consider if *All Day* reduces the number of people who attend concerts for the artists sampled. No one would see Girltalk instead of, for example, Ludacris, just because he is sampled. If anything, *All Day* could introduce people to new artists, thus increasing their ticket sales.

It is also important to consider, to some degree, the effect on album sales. Again, since the samples are so minimal when compared to an entire album, it is unlikely that *All Day* will negatively effect album sales.


## An Overview
|Fair use factor|Does this help the case for fair use?|
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
|Purpose and Character|Yes|
|Nature of the work|Does not apply much|
|Amount and Substantiality|Yes|
|Effect upon the market|Yes|

The table above summarizes how the four factors of fair use affect Girl Talk's case. Obviously, where it does apply, *All Day* has a pretty good case for being considered fair use. Ultimately, the law is vague in many areas, so the decision is subjective. However, it would be difficult to find enough supporting evidence to claim otherwise. This decision might be different from how other mashups could be ruled, though. A mashup that uses the "heart" of only a couple songs could easily be considered a violation of fait use. Even though Girl Talk's case passes, it is so unique that it would not make a good precedent for other cases.
